# awesome-mpc [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

The list format was inspired from [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and after a fruitful lunch discussion at [TPMPC](http://www.multipartycomputation.com/). It is designed to have a central place where everyone can find open-source software designed for MPC as well as introductory material to this topic.

Moreover, the list is given alphabetically and divided into categories of libraries which are actively maintained or recently developed.

Please feel free to do a pull request with any MPC software or resource you know and it is not on the list. The current classification might not be most suitable one and I am open to any suggestions.
