# awesome-mpc [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Multiparty computation (MPC) allows several parties to jointly compute on secrets without revealing them. This list is designed to be a central place where everyone can find open-source software designed for MPC as well as introductory material to this topic.
The list format is inspired from [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and after a fruitful lunch discussion at [TPMPC](http://www.multipartycomputation.com/) back in 2017 in Bristol.

Moreover, the list is given alphabetically and divided into categories of libraries which are actively maintained or recently developed.

Please feel free to do a pull request with any MPC software or resource you know and it is not on the list. The current classification might not be most suitable one and I am open to any suggestions.
